*NotEnoughOPItems*

Basically Avaritia for fabric (but worse).

Please, for the love of god, if putting this in your
modpack ever even crosses your mind, do yourself a favour
and edit the recipes.

## FAQ
Q: What / How can I contribute?  
A: Textures, bug reports, ideas, PRs, whatever crosses your
mind. (TBH I don't even know why you'd like to. It'd be
a good learning experience, maybe?.)

Q: The whole "Atomic X" thing is stupid.  
A: I know, it is supposed to be ironic since the mod
itself is also stupid.

Q: Why?  
A: Because.

# NEOPI
*NotEnoughOPItems*

Basically Avaritia for fabric (but worse).

Please, for the love of god, if putting this in your
modpack ever even crosses your mind, do yourself a favour
and edit the recipes.

## FAQ
Q: What / How can I contribute?  
A: Textures, bug reports, ideas, PRs, whatever crosses your
mind. Any contribution is greatly appreciated.

Q: The whole "Atomic X" thing is stupid.  
A: I know, it is supposed to be ironic since the mod
itself is also stupid.

Q: Why?  
A: Because.

## Compiling
Just as any other mod, run ./gradlew build. You'll find
the artifacts in build/libs/. Choose the shortest named
one.

If you don't want to compile the mod for yourself, you
can grab the latest artifacts from github actions. Beware
that these may be unstable and/or not work.
